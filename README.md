# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects Portfolio

## Overview
This repository is a collection of projects exploring **machine learning, deep learning, and model deployment**.  
Each project builds on core concepts â€” from Python basics and data handling, to implementing algorithms from scratch, to modern deep learning frameworks and deployment pipelines.

The repo is structured to showcase:
- **Hands-on implementations** (from scratch and with libraries)
- **Exploratory data analysis**
- **Model training and tuning**
- **Interpretability and visualization**
- **Real-world deployment workflows**
